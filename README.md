What isthe difference between React, React JS, and React Native?
    1. React
    "React" is often used as a shorthand for React JS, the core library developed by Meta (Facebook).

    Context:
    When people say "React" without further context, they usually mean React JS, the JavaScript library for building web user interfaces.

    2. React JS (React.js or ReactJS)
    A JavaScript library used to build web applications ‚Äî specifically the UI (User Interface).

    Key points:

    Runs in the browser.
    Uses HTML and CSS alongside JSX (JavaScript XML).
    Components are rendered to the DOM (Document Object Model).
    Works well with tools like Webpack, Babel, and frameworks like Next.js.
    Example use:
    Building a dashboard, blog, or single-page web app (SPA).

    3. React Native
    A framework for building native mobile apps using React.

    Key points:

    Uses native components (e.g., <View>, <Text>) instead of HTML.
    Translates your code into native code for iOS and Android.
    Still uses JavaScript and JSX, but with React Native components.
    You style with JavaScript-based styling, not traditional CSS.

Is React a framework or a library?
    React is a library, not a full framework.
    It‚Äôs specifically a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily the view layer in an application (the ‚ÄúV‚Äù in MVC).

Compare and contrast HTML and JSX.
    HTML is the standard markup language used to structure content on the web, using elements like <div>, <p>, and <a>.
    JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React that looks like HTML but allows you to embed JavaScript expressions and use components ‚Äî making it more dynamic and interactive.

    Key difference: JSX must be transpiled (e.g., with Babel), and uses className instead of class, htmlFor instead of for, etc., due to its JavaScript nature.

Why Use React.JS for Rocket Elevators?
    React.JS makes Rocket Elevators‚Äô web platform faster, easier to maintain, and ready for future innovation ‚Äî from interactive client dashboards to internal control panels.

    By adopting React, we position ourselves for long-term efficiency and growth in both user experience and development productivity.

Why MERN is a Good Choice for Full Development ?
1. Single Language (JavaScript) Across the Stack

One language for client, server, and database logic = easier development and collaboration.
Developers can work full-stack without switching languages or mental models.
2. Efficient Front-End with React.js

Build fast, responsive UIs with reusable components.
Supports real-time data updates ‚Äî ideal for dashboards, admin panels, or live elevator tracking.
3. Robust Back-End with Node.js + Express.js

Node.js is fast, non-blocking, and great for real-time apps.
Express.js simplifies routing, middleware, and RESTful APIs.
Together, they handle everything from authentication to database communication.
4. Flexible, Scalable Database with MongoDB

A document-oriented NoSQL database ‚Äî works naturally with JavaScript objects (JSON).
Schema-less flexibility allows you to evolve features like user roles, service logs, or elevator specs without rigid SQL schemas.
5. Open Source + Massive Community

Free to use with strong community support.
Tons of libraries, tools, and tutorials to speed up development.
6. Great for Rapid Prototyping and Iteration

MERN enables quick development cycles, which is perfect for evolving business needs.
Easily deployable to cloud platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.

What are a few alternate tech stacks?

1. MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)
    Front-end: Angular (instead of React)
    Back-end: Same as MERN (Express + Node.js)
    Database: MongoDB
    Good for: Large-scale enterprise apps, projects needing strict structure
    Downside: Angular has a steeper learning curve than React

2. JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup)
    Front-end: Static site generators (Next.js, Gatsby)
    Back-end: Headless CMS (Sanity, Strapi), APIs (REST/GraphQL)
    Hosting: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages
    Good for: Fast, secure, SEO-friendly websites (landing pages, blogs, marketing sites)
    Downside: Dynamic functionality needs external APIs

3. LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
    Server: Apache on Linux
    Back-end: PHP
    Database: MySQL
    Good for: Legacy projects, WordPress-based solutions
    Downside: Less modern, not JavaScript-based

4. Spring Boot + React or Angular (Java stack)
    Back-end: Spring Boot (Java)
    Front-end: React or Angular
    Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL
    Good for: Enterprise-grade apps, high security, strong type safety
    Downside: Java requires more boilerplate and setup

5. Python/Django + React (or Vue)
    Back-end: Django or Django REST Framework (Python)
    Front-end: React or Vue
    Database: PostgreSQL
    Good for: Rapid development, secure applications (admin panels, dashboards)
    Downside: Requires managing two different languages (Python + JS)

üåê 6. .NET Stack (C# + ASP.NET Core + Blazor/React + SQL Server)
    Back-end: ASP.NET Core (C#)
    Front-end: React, Razor Pages, or Blazor
    Database: SQL Server
    Good for: Enterprise apps, finance, or government systems
    Downside: Microsoft ecosystem may add licensing or hosting cost

Mern Repo :
1. https://github.com/gitdagray/mern_stack_course:

    A Redux store holds the entire state of the application in one central location, making it easier to manage and debug. 
    It allows components to access state and dispatch actions consistently through a predictable flow.

2. https://github.com/amazingandyyy/mern:
    
    Deploying to Heroku involves pushing the application code to a remote Heroku Git repository, where Heroku automatically builds and runs the app. It supports various languages and frameworks, and you can easily configure environment variables, scale resources, and monitor app performance from the Heroku dashboard.
